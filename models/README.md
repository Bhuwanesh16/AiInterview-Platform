# Models directory

Place your pretrained emotion detection model here:

- **emotion_model.h5** – Keras/TensorFlow model for emotion classification (e.g. 7 emotions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, neutral).

Input shape and classes must match what `analyzer/emotion_detection.py` expects.
